Why do programmers use pseudocode?

1. Pseudocode is a language that helps programmers create algorithms. It is a language meant for humans to easily be able to read and not computers. Simply its a brainstorming language before you start to code. 

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

2. You will get an error. It is not meant to run on a computer.


Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE IF the first number is equal to the second number THEN
  PRINT "The numbers are equal."
ELSE
  PRINT second number
END IF


Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT count to 0
REPEAT 
  ADD 1 to count
RETURN count
UNTIL the count is 100


Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT full name
IF full name is equal to name in phonebook THEN
   PRINT phone number for the name
ELSE 
   PRINT "Not listed"
END IF


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phoneBook = [
  {name: "Jared Davies", phoneNumber: "111-222-3333"},
  {name: "John Davies", phoneNumber: "444-555-6666"}
]

function search(fullName){
  for (let i=0; i<phoneBook.length; i++){
	if (fullName === phoneBook[i].name){
		return phoneBook[i].phoneNumber;
	}
	else {
		console.log("Not Listed");
	}
  }
}

search("Jared Davies");
