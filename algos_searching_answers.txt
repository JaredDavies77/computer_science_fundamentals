Short Answer
What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A real-life example would be waiting in line a roller coaster and the attendant going through the line in order to find a single rider. 

What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A real-life example would be when I search for a member's golf bag. All the slots are numbered. I go to the middle and from there I know if I need to go forward or backward depending on the number I am looking for. 

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7 iterations

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
3 iterations

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Since it was unsorted then a binary search gives you no benefit. You want to start from the beginning by using a linear search. Otherwise with binary you would be totally guessing.

Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Since it is sorted you would now use a binary search because it would dramatically increase you speed with much less iterations needed.



Programming Assignment:
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findAlbatross(sorted, word){    
  var low = 0;
  var high = sorted.length - 1;
  while (low <= high){
    var mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (sorted[mid] == word){
        console.log(mid);
        return mid;
    } else if (sorted[mid] < word){
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1; 
    }
  } console.log(null);
  return null;
}
  

var dictonary = ["able", "albatross", "blue", "cat", "dog", "orange", "zebra"];
findAlbatross(dictonary, "albatross");
findAlbatross(dictonary, "white")

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findWhite(animal, color) {
  for (var i=0; i<= animal.length; i++) {
    if (animal[i] == color) {
      console.log(i);
      return i;
    }
    console.log(null);
  } return null;
}
var fish = ["orange", "orange", "white-spotted", "orange"];
findWhite(fish, "white-spotted"); 
findWhite(fish, "pink");
