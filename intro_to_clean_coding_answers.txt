1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.

Clean code is important because usually you will not be the only one working on the code and you will need to make it easy for others to understand what you are doing. Also for you to maintain as adjustments are needed.

Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard.

All forms of transportation now rely on computers. However, the most scary I think are weapons. All major weapons systems are controlled by computers. You could potentially start a world war if one of those would accidentally would go off by a bug or bad coding. 

Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code. 

I do not think this is clean code. There is a comment on every line.

FUNCTION do(x, y)              
 IF y = "F" THEN               
 SET z to (xâˆ’32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       
 ELSE IF y = "C" THEN          
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                      
 END IF
END FUNCTION

Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

I think this is clean code. Very simple and to the point.

FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION


Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the principles you have learned in this checkpoint.

a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and receives payment accordingly.

FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   	CALL payment WITH subTotal, discountRate, and paymentType
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION payment(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   END IF
END FUNCTION

b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the guest's account.


FUNCTION allowed(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive AND NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) AND guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
     CALL checkoutBook with book and guest
    END IF
ELSE
 PRINT "Unable to check out book."
END FUNCTION


FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
  APPEND book to guest.books
  SET book.status to "Checked Out"
  PRINT "Your books have been issued."
END FUNCTION


c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions a customer can perform at an ATM.

You do not need the extra functions at the end. Only need transactions for customer not promotions.

CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION


 ....

Programming Questions
You may do the following problems in any language of your choice. Use the clean code principles taught in this section while writing the code.

6. Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root, otherwise return the sum.

Example:
[10,1,4,6,1,1,2] returns 5 because the square root of 25 is 5.
[1,1] returns 2 because 2 is not a perfect square.
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414213562373095.

function square(numbers){
  var sum = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i<numbers.length; i++){
		sum += numbers[i];
	}
	var root = Math.sqrt(sum)
	if (Number.isInteger(root)){
		return root;
	}
	else {
		return sum;
	}
}

7. Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

function(integers) {
    for(let i = 0; i <= integers.length; i++) {
        for(var b = i; b <= a.length; b++) {
            if(i != b && a[i] == a[b]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

8. Anagram An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, spar can be formed from rasp. Given two strings, stringOne and stringTwo, determine if stringOne is an anagram of stringTwo. Assume that the strings contain only lowercase letters and do not worry about case-sensitivity. Hint: Your first task will be to convert the strings to arrays.

I will come back to this as extra practice.
