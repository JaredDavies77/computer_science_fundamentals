What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

Pros:Easy to insert and delete, flexible in size

Cons:Must start from the beginning always when searching for an element, can take longer


Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A real world example of a linked list would be a video game story mode that you must complete each level to move on to the next. 

The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 SET current to head
 	WHILE current.next exists
	SET current to current.next
 SET current.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION


This is only accounting for if there is not a head node or if there only is a head node. It needs to continue to move through the list until the end of the list. 



class Node {
	constructor(val){
		this.value = val;
		this.next = null;
	}
}

head = new Node(1),
a = new Node(2),
b = new Node(3),
c = new Node(3),
d = new Node(1);

head.next = a;
a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;
d.next = null;

  function printList(ll){ 
    var current = ll; 
    var str = ""; 
    while (current !== null) { 
        str += current.value + " "; 
        current = current.next; 
    } 
    console.log(str); 
} 

printList(head);

	
	function push(element){
		var e = new Node(element);
		if(head === null){
			head = e;
		} 
		else {
			var curr = head;
			while(curr.next){
				curr = curr.next;
			}
			curr.next = e;
            e.next = null;
		}
	}


push(2);
printList(head);




Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
1-2-3-3-1
h a b c d
Output: a -> c -> d

I need to create a function that first prints the list. Once the list is printed I will use an if statement inside an if statement to remove duplicates. The first if statement will determine if the value has been seen before. If it has not it will continue. If it has been seen it will move to the next if statement that will remove the duplicate from the list.  


class Node {
	constructor(val){
		this.value = val;
		this.next = null;
	}
}

let head = new Node(1),
a = new Node(2),
b = new Node(3),
c = new Node(3),
d = new Node(1);

head.next = a;
a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;
d.next = null;

function printList(ll){ 
    var current = ll; 
    var str = ""; 
    while (current !== null) { 
        str += current.value + " "; 
        current = current.next; 
    } 
    console.log(str); 
} 

printList(head);

function removeDuplicates(ll){
  let prev, 
      curr = ll, 
      seen = [];
  
  while(curr !== null){
    if (seen.indexOf(curr.value) >= 0){
      if (curr.next !== null){
        prev.next = curr.next;
        curr = curr.next;
      } else {
        prev.next = null;
        curr = null;
      }
    } else {
      seen.push(curr.value);
      prev = curr;
      curr = curr.next;
    }
  }
  
  return ll;
}
removeDuplicates(head);
printList(head);


I created a list for the current letter order. Then I popped all of them into the original list to make the original list reversed.

Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

class Node {
  constructor(val){
    this.value = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

let head = new Node("a"),
    a = new Node("b"),
    b = new Node("c"),
    c = new Node("d");


head.next = a;
a.next = b;
b.next = c;


function printList(ll){
  var current = ll;
  var str = "";
  while (current !== null) {
    str += current.value + " ";
    current = current.next;
  }
  console.log(str);
}

printList(head);



function reverse(ll){
  let stack = [];
  while (ll !== null){
    stack.push(ll);
    ll = ll.next;
  }

  ll = stack.pop();

  let cur = ll;
  while(stack.length > 0){

    cur.next = stack.pop();
    cur = cur.next;
  }
  cur.next = null;

  return ll;
}

let r = reverse(head);
printList(r);
