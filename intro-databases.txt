Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database would be used when you need to manage data that can be accessed by multiple applications and can read or changed. A text file would be used only when the creator of the application is the only one accessing and changing it. It is only good for set data for users not data that is updated.  

Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

The main difference is that SQL is declarative and many other languages like javascript are imperative.

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

At a high level for example when using a database to track users. You may need to keep track of usernames and passwords for them to login. Also, you may need to keep track of their email for marketing or if they interact with the site and need an email receipt or response. Also, you may use their name or a username to identify the user. Lastly, you may also keep track of birthdates for marketing or special discounts. The list is endless for how data in a database can be used and fits together under each user. This is all done in SQL by using tables with column and rows to neatly keep track of everything. 

Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Table - is entire data set
Row - an entire single data entry
Column- specifics about each data entry
Value - type of data entry in each cell
